##What is a Variable

**VARIABLES** are like "labeled-Jars" For a Value in JavaScript

We Can store a value and give it a name so that we can...

-Recall it 
-Use it
-or Change it Later on

##Basic Syntax

``let someName = value;``
##Recall Variables

``let Cats = 2;
  let Dogs = 1;``
  
##Update Variables

``let controllers = 2;

//an angrey Gamer Broke a controller into Pisces :(

controllers -1;

controllers;

//to actually change controllers 

controllers = -1;

controllers; ``

##What is Let ?
**LET** allows you to declare Vars that are limited to the scope of a block statement

```let somename = value;```

**Example** 

```let pets = 14;
  {
     
     let cat = 7;
     
     cat + 2; //9
  
  }  
     
cat + 10; // 25 ```

## What is Const 

**CONST** Works just like let expect you CANNONT change the value.

```const somename = value;```

**Example** of const

```const cars = 15;
  
  cars = 20; ```
  
  ```const trucks = 20; 
    
    trucks = trucks + 10;```

## What is Var ? 

Before let and cost Var Was the only way of declaring variables. these days there isn't really a reason to use it.

```var somename = value;```

**example of var **

```var cars = 15;
   {
   
   car + 5; //20
   
   }
  
  car + 10 //25```
